1. In-order - it is a form of representation of binary tree elements in which all elements are sorted and stored in ascending order i.e. store the smallest elemts as we iterate through the node..
2. Pre-order - it is a form of representation of binary tree elements in which we store the elements in an array as we iterate through the nodes.
3. Post-order - it is a form of representation of binary tree elements in which we store the greatest element of a tree in an array as we iterate to the node.
T.C. O(N)
S.C. O(d)->depth of the tree
