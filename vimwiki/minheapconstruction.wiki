In this algorithm, we have to place the elements in sych a way that the parent node will be less than its child node and each node will have exact 2 nodes.
T.C. O(logN)->Sift up && Sift down  \\ T.C. O(N) -> Build heap
S.C. O(1)

We generally use heap to keep track of smallest value and greatest value.
