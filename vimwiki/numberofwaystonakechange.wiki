In this process, we are using dynamic programming of tabulation method to calculate the number of ways we can get a change for a certain value of amount in this problem we have value 10 and to get 10 we first create an Array name as the ways and ways[0]=1 because if we do not have any value then it will be one as the zero equals to zero for now we will start iterating for each value of denomination we have and calculate the number of ways that we could make change calculate the place for a certain way so here we have infinite number of denominations and the number of the denominations are are as given so for one we have value of one in our database for second we can add one and one and get two and this will be valid till 10 then we will do this for 5 we can take one coin 5 and for 6 we can take 5 and 1 same for 7 = 5 + 1 + 1 and this will be valid till 10 the same will continue for 10 and through this way we will get the total number of changes for our current amount.

T.C. O(N*d) n=amount,d=denominations
S.C. O(N)
