    <p>
        A technique to characterize the execution time of an algorithm independently from the machine, the language and
        the compiler.

        <li>
            Complexity analysis is a technique to analyze and compare
            algorithms (not programs).
        <li>
            It helps to have preliminary back-of-the-envelope
            estimations of runtime (milliseconds, seconds, minutes,
            days, years?).
        <li>
            Worst-case analysis is sometimes overly pessimistic.
            Average case is also interesting (not covered in this course).
        <li>
            In many application domains (e.g., big data) quadratic
            complexity, O(n^2), is not acceptable.
        <li>
            Recommendation: avoid last-minute surprises by doing
            complexity analysis before writing code.
