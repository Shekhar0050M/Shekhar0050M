<p>
In this problem we have to find the longest peak so in this problem first iterate through all the elements of the array and if you find a peak then for that peak calculate the depth of the peak that is from the position of that peak running while loop to the left side and the right side and calculate the number of elements that keep strictly decreasing, store the  value compare the value and print the maximum peak.
